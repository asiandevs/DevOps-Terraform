##### Need to update taint feature -MM

[ec2-user@ip-10-0-14-30 terraform]$ terraform taint aws_instance.webserver
Resource instance aws_instance.webserver has been marked as tainted.


Step2: import a resource into configuration management
We can use below command to import existing resource inside terraform configuration 
i: terraform init
ii: terraform import aws_instance.mymanualinstance <instance id>
iv: terraform show
sample output: 
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-14-30 import]$ cat main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "mysrcinstance" {}
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-14-30 import]$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.66.1...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.66.1 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
